# ShiftMate

ShiftMate is a mobile application being built to help shift workers manage their work schedules, routines, and personal productivity more effectively.

The app is designed with people who work long, rotating day/night shifts in mind—where consistency is hard, fatigue is real, and structure matters.

## 🎯 Purpose

ShiftMate aims to:
- Provide a simple, focused dashboard for shift-based workers
- Help users transition between work shifts with better structure
- Serve as a practical, real-world Flutter project showcasing clean architecture and state management

This project is also part of my transition into full-time software engineering.
